Hi Folx,

Please post your resources here to share with your fellow Turing members.

Please read the contribution guidelines and try to include a brief explanation of the resource your posting if it isn't obvious.

How to use the repo!

clone the repo to your local machine using git clone 

once you have done this you will have a copy of the repo on your local machine where you can add resources.

to sync those changes to the remote repo so everyone has access you will need to add commit and then push.

i will include a brief document with instructions on how to do so or alternatively you can visit:

https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github

to view a getting started with git document.



Happy Sharing!
